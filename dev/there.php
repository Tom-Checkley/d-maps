						Begun in Bristol in 2012 with research and map-making for the “ A-Z of Sheds” including a set of 8 postcards for Stanfords Map Shop, d-map has produced several guides – including an “M Shed” map for wheelchair users and visually impaired participants – and a measured route-walk  for Mina Road Park.
					<br><br>
						Hand-cut stencils resulted in T shirt and bag prints in short runs for local and topical subjects: “Tide” for Highwaterline, “Chimney” for Underfall Yard, “DJ Derek ?”, “Overproof Rum” and individual commissions.
					<br><br>
						Continuing with mapping, the footpaths (and contours) from Brandon Hill to the ZigZag is under construction.
					<br><br>
						D-map offers location and direction/distance graphics to order. Stock-stencils and maps can be made large or small on paper, card and textile. Carvings and ink-stamps are also on offer. Affordable pricing and fast delivery are standard. The studio at Conduit Place is open by appointment and site-visits are free, initially. Successful exhibitions have been held at Tobacco Factory , Paintworks , Arnolfini Gallery and British Crafts Council.
